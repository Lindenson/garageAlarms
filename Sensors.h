// The original sketch used `latched = latched || digitalRead(pin) == LOW`, which accepts a
// single sample and holds it forever — a noise spike on a long garage cable was
// indistinguishable from a real event. Here an input must hold the active level
// continuously for `debounceMs` before it counts, and after firing it is ignored for
// `cooldownMs` so one event yields one notification.
